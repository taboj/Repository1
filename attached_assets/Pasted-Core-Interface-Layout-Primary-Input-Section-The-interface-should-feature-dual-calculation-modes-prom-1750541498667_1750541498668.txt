Core Interface Layout
Primary Input Section
The interface should feature dual calculation modes prominently displayed at the top:

"I want to wake up at..." - Large, prominent time picker

"I want to go to bed now..." - Alternative calculation option

Both options should use intuitive time selection controls with smooth scrolling or slider mechanisms rather than traditional dropdown menus. The time picker should be large enough for easy mobile interaction while maintaining desktop usability.

Personalization Controls
Essential customization options should be easily accessible but not overwhelming:

Fall asleep time slider (5-30 minutes, defaulting to 15 minutes)

Sleep cycle length adjustment (80-100 minutes, defaulting to 90 minutes)

Number of preferred cycles (4-6 cycles for different sleep needs)

These controls should be visually integrated into the main interface rather than hidden in settings menus.

Visual Design Elements
Color Scheme and Theme
The interface must include dual theme support:

Dark mode: Black background with mint and soft accent colors to reduce eye strain during nighttime use

Light mode: Clean white background with subtle blue accents for daytime accessibility

The dark theme is absolutely critical since users often access sleep calculators late at night, and bright screens can disrupt circadian rhythms.

Typography and Readability
Text hierarchy should be clear and scannable:

Large, bold numbers for calculated times

Clean, modern sans-serif fonts (SF Pro or similar)

High contrast ratios for accessibility

Readable font sizes across all devices

Visual Feedback System
The interface should provide immediate visual feedback:

Real-time calculation updates as users adjust inputs

Color-coded sleep quality indicators for each recommended time

Smooth animations during transitions and calculations

Progress indicators showing sleep cycle completeness

Results Display
Multiple Time Recommendations
Rather than showing a single result, display 3-4 optimal wake-up times:

Each time should show the number of complete sleep cycles

Quality indicators (excellent, good, fair) for each option

Time until each wake-up option for quick reference

Sleep Cycle Visualization
Include a simple graphical representation:

Timeline showing sleep phases (light, deep, REM)

Visual markers indicating recommended wake-up windows

Clean, minimalist charts that don't overwhelm the interface

Interactive Features
Smart Recommendations
The calculator should provide contextual advice:

Brief sleep tips based on calculated bedtime

Warnings for insufficient sleep (less than 4 cycles)

Suggestions for sleep schedule optimization

Quick Action Buttons
Include immediate utility features:

"Set alarm for this time" button

"Remind me to go to bed" notification option

"Calculate reverse" to switch between bedtime/wake time modes

Mobile-First Design Considerations
Touch-Friendly Controls
All interactive elements should be optimized for mobile use:

Minimum 44px touch targets

Generous spacing between clickable elements

Swipe gestures for time adjustment

Responsive design that works across all screen sizes

Performance Optimization
The interface should be lightweight and fast:

Instant calculations without loading delays

Minimal external dependencies

Optimized images and graphics

Progressive web app capabilities for offline use

Advanced Interface Elements
Educational Integration
Include subtle educational components:

Brief explanation of sleep cycles

Tips for better sleep hygiene

Scientific backing for recommendations

Links to additional sleep resources

Accessibility Features
Ensure universal usability:

Screen reader compatibility

Keyboard navigation support

High contrast mode options

Text size adjustment capabilities

Information Architecture
Logical Flow Design
The interface should guide users through a natural progression:

Input selection (wake time or bedtime)

Personalization (fall asleep time, cycle length)

Results display with multiple options

Action items (set alarms, save preferences)

Progressive Disclosure
Advanced features should be easily accessible but not prominent:

Settings panel that slides in when needed

Expandable help sections

Optional detailed explanations

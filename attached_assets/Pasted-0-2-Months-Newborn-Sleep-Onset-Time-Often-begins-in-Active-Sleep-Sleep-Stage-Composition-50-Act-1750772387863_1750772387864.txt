0–2 Months (Newborn)
Sleep Onset Time: Often begins in Active Sleep
Sleep Stage Composition: 50% Active Sleep (AS), 50% Quiet Sleep (QS)
Important: At this tender age, a newborn's brain is undergoing incredibly rapid development and hasn't yet developed the mature, clear-cut NREM stages (N1, N2, N3) seen in older individuals. Therefore, sleep scientists use the observable categories of “active” and “quiet” sleep as fundamental descriptors. Active Sleep (AS) is the direct precursor and analogous to adult REM sleep, serving similar critical brain development functions, while Quiet Sleep (QS) is analogous to adult Non-REM (NREM) sleep, providing foundational rest.
Research-Based Notes:
🌙 Unique Sleep Start
Newborns are the only age group that start sleep in Active Sleep (their version of REM). As they grow, they’ll shift to starting in quiet sleep like older kids and adults.
🔁 What Are “Proto-Cycles”?
Your baby sleeps in short cycles (~40–60 minutes) that alternate between:
Active Sleep (AS): lots of movement, brain activity


Quiet Sleep (QS): still and restful


These early cycles are the building blocks of healthy sleep.
⏱️ The 45-Minute Wake-Up (aka "The Intruder")
It’s common for newborns to wake fully after just one cycle — especially around 30–45 minutes. This can happen if:
They’re hungry


They’re overtired or overstimulated


They’re practicing new milestones like rolling


Their bedtime routine is inconsistent


What to do:
 Before jumping in, pause. Your baby might settle back on their own. Try gentle soothing, check if they’re hungry, and make sure the room is cool, dark, and quiet.
🌞 Day vs. Night: Not Yet!
Newborns don’t have a circadian rhythm yet. Their internal clock hasn’t kicked in — they sleep in short bursts and wake every 2–3 hours to feed.
 By 2–3 months, you may start noticing longer nighttime stretches as their rhythm matures.
Recommended Wake Time: At the end of a full ~45-min proto-cycle, ideally during light Quiet Sleep. This is generally the easiest time to wake your baby, as they are transitioning out of a sleep state, making the wake-up smoother and less disruptive for both parent and child.
Sleep Stage Functions (Research-Based):
Active Sleep: This is the newborn equivalent of REM sleep, where the brain is highly active, resembling wakefulness. You might observe rapid eye movements, twitching, and vocalizations. This stage is supremely critical for rapid brain maturation, the formation of new neural connections (synapses), and the overall development of the nervous system. It's where the brain actively processes and consolidates new experiences, even those experienced in utero.
Quiet Sleep: Comparable to NREM sleep in adults, this phase sees the newborn become very still with deep, regular breathing. While lacking the defined NREM sub-stages of older individuals, Quiet Sleep provides essential basic restorative functions and vital physical rest, supporting the immense physical growth occurring in this period.
3–5 Months (Early Infant)
Sleep Onset Time: Transitions to NREM, though REM-onset still possible
Sleep Stage Composition: 60% NREM (mostly N2 and N3; N1 present but minimal, typically under 5%), 40% REM
Important: This age marks a significant developmental leap in sleep architecture. While N1 remains very short and transitional (often lasting only a few minutes), the functional focus shifts dramatically to the emergence and strengthening of N2 and N3. These stages are more stable and significant, laying the groundwork for the more complex and restorative sleep of later development.
🧠 Research-Based Notes
🧩 Real Sleep Stages Are Taking Shape
Your baby’s sleep is maturing! Around this age, they start cycling through real sleep stages like REM, light sleep (N2), and deep sleep (N3) — replacing the less organized sleep patterns from the newborn stage. This helps them rest better and grow stronger.
🌞 Day-Night Rhythm Starts Clicking
Their circadian rhythm (body clock) is finally waking up. You’ll start to notice:
Longer stretches of nighttime sleep


More alertness during the day


Less random waking
Tip: Open the curtains in the morning and dim the lights at night — natural light helps their rhythm settle into a day-night pattern.
⏳ Sleep Cycles Are Getting Longer
Instead of short newborn-style cycles, your baby’s sleep is now stretching toward more mature patterns — about 50 minutes per cycle. This means more time in each stage, and potentially longer stretches of continuous sleep at night.
Recommended Wake Time: Align with the light sleep stage at the end of a full ~50-minute cycle. Waking during a light sleep stage helps to avoid waking them from deep sleep, which can lead to grogginess or fussiness.
Sleep Stage Functions (Research-Based):
REM: Continues to be vital for active memory consolidation of the day's new experiences and supports the early brain development essential for cognitive leaps like recognizing faces and responding to sounds.
Non-REM: With the emergence of N2 and N3, Non-REM sleep begins to provide more significant physical restoration and deeper rest. This is crucial as babies become more active and start developing motor skills.
6–11 Months (Late Infant)
Sleep Onset Time: Technically begins in NREM stage N1, but this stage is very short. Most observable sleep begins in N2.
Sleep Stage Composition: ~70% NREM (N1 ≈ 5%, N2 ≈ 40%, N3 ≈ 25%), ~30% REM
Important: Sleep at this age becomes remarkably more organized and predictable. All major sleep stages—N1, N2, N3 (deep sleep), and REM—are now consistently present and begin to follow a more predictable, cyclical pattern. This structured sleep is essential for their rapid cognitive and physical development.
🧠 Research-Based Notes
😴 A More Grown-Up Sleep Pattern
Your baby now usually falls asleep through light sleep (N2), then moves into deep sleep (N3) and REM, just like adults. Their sleep is becoming more predictable and structured.
⏱️ Longer Sleep Cycles = Better Nights
Sleep cycles are now about 60 minutes long. This gives your baby more time in each stage and helps them sleep for longer stretches at night — a win for everyone.
🌙 Body Clock Kicking In
Their circadian rhythm is maturing, meaning their body is starting to sync with light, dark, and routine. Consistent bedtimes and wake times now make a real difference.
Tip: Keep mornings bright and evenings calm and dim — it helps reinforce the day-night pattern.
🚼 Big Milestones Can Stir Things Up
New skills like crawling, babbling, or sitting up can cause temporary sleep hiccups. That’s normal — their brain is busy growing.
Tip: Stick to your sleep routines and help your baby practice new skills during the day. A little extra comfort at night can go a long way.

Recommended Wake Time: At the end of a full ~60-minute cycle, ideally during light N2. Waking during this lighter stage makes the transition smoother and helps avoid the grogginess and fussiness often associated with being roused from deep sleep.
Sleep Stage Functions (Research-Based):
N1 Sleep (≈5%): A very brief, light entry point into sleep—the transitional phase where the brain begins to slow down. It's easily disrupted, meaning even small sounds can cause a baby to stir.
N2 Sleep (≈40%): This is the most frequent and dominant stage of sleep at this age. It's crucial for supporting learning, memory consolidation (like remembering faces and routines), and the development of motor skills (such as rolling and crawling).
N3 Sleep (≈25%): Also known as deep or slow-wave sleep, this stage is essential for physical growth (with growth hormone release), immune system support, and significant physical recovery from their active days.
REM Sleep (≈30%): During REM sleep, the baby's brain is highly active. This stage plays a vital role in language development, emotional regulation (processing new stimuli), and integrating and processing daytime experiences, laying the groundwork for complex cognitive functions.
12–23 Months (Toddler)
Sleep Onset Time: Begins in NREM stage N1, quickly transitioning into N2. N1 remains brief but is now consistently present, marking a stable entry into sleep.
Sleep Stage Composition: ~25% REM, ~75% NREM (5% N1, 45% N2, 25% N3)
Note: These proportions reflect a remarkably stabilized, adult-like sleep architecture that is clearly emerging and strengthening by the end of this stage.
Important: By this pivotal age, toddlers consistently cycle through all four major sleep stages (N1, N2, N3, REM) in a predictable and recognizable pattern. Nighttime sleep significantly consolidates, and while naps begin to decrease in frequency (often transitioning from two to one), they remain developmentally essential for managing daytime fatigue and supporting learning.
🧠 Research-Based Notes (Refined for 12–23 Months)
⏳ Sleep Cycles Are Settling In
Your toddler now has consistent 60–75 minute sleep cycles, showing steady progress toward adult-like sleep structure. This means more predictable naps and nighttime rhythms.
🛠️ Deep Sleep Powers Growth
Deep sleep (N3) is still strong — especially in the early part of the night. This stage is key for:
Physical growth


Cell repair


Energy restoration


It’s when a lot of that growing magic happens.
🧠 REM Sleep = Brain in Action
As your toddler’s brain learns new words, skills, and emotions, REM sleep helps them:
Process memories


Make sense of new experiences


Regulate emotions


Think of it as overnight mental organization.
🚶‍♂️ Milestones Can Stir Things Up
New skills like walking, talking, or even asserting independence can cause sleep disruptions. Nap refusal or sudden wake-ups are usually normal and temporary.
Tip:
 Keep your bedtime routine predictable, and let your toddler practice new skills during the day. If they wake up at night, stay calm and consistent — they’ll settle with your reassurance.

Recommended Wake Time: Aim to wake at the end of a full ~70-minute cycle, ideally during N2 (light sleep). This timing helps to avoid waking them from deep sleep or active REM, which can lead to notable grogginess, fussiness, or "sleep inertia" in toddlers.
Sleep Stage Functions (Research-Based):
N1 (Light Transition): A brief, essential gateway from wakefulness into sleep. While not deeply restorative, it’s necessary for entry into the sleep cycle and is the stage from which toddlers are most easily aroused.
N2 (Light Sleep): This prominent stage is critical for consolidating motor skill memory (like walking and climbing), aids in emotional regulation (processing big toddler feelings), and is the ideal stage for a smoother waking transition.
N3 (Deep Sleep): Often called slow-wave sleep, N3 is the powerhouse of physical restoration. It strongly promotes growth hormone release, supports the immune system, and facilitates crucial brain detoxification processes that clear metabolic waste.
REM: This active brain state significantly boosts language acquisition and vocabulary building, enhances emotional processing of their complex world, and aids in memory integration of all the new skills and concepts they're absorbing.
2–4 Years (Preschooler)
Sleep Onset Time: Begins in NREM stage N1, followed by a longer duration in N2 (light sleep). This is now the consistently most common starting pattern for initiating sleep.
Sleep Stage Composition: ~25% REM, ~75% NREM (5% N1, 45% N2, 25% N3)
Note: The overall sleep structure at this age closely resembles adult sleep patterns, but preschoolers still dedicate a substantial amount of time to deep sleep (N3), particularly within their early night cycles, reflecting ongoing rapid development.
Important: Sleep architecture is now remarkably well-established in preschoolers. Although the percentage of REM sleep may drop slightly compared to infancy, deep sleep (N3) remains notably high. This sustained presence of deep sleep is crucial for supporting their continued rapid physical growth, immune system development, and the intense cognitive maturation occurring as they learn, play, and explore.

🧠 Research-Based Notes (Refined for 2–4 Years)
⏱️ Longer Sleep Cycles = Better Rest
Your child’s sleep cycles now last around 80 minutes, supporting deeper, more continuous sleep. Their sleep system is working more efficiently, helping them stay asleep longer.
💤 Deep Sleep Does the Heavy Lifting
Deep sleep (N3) is still dominant, especially early in the night. It’s essential for:
Physical growth


Cell repair and healing


Building a strong immune system


This helps them recover and stay healthy as they explore the world.
🧠 REM Fuels the Mind
REM sleep supports:
Emotional processing


Language learning


Social understanding and imagination


It’s especially important now as your child starts forming relationships and expressing themselves more.
😵‍💫 Imagination = Sleep Challenges
Nightmares, bedtime resistance, or fears of the dark are common — your preschooler’s imagination is growing fast. These are normal and usually not signs of a sleep disorder.
Tip:
 Keep bedtime calm and predictable. Reassure your child if they’re scared, but stay firm with boundaries. A cozy, secure sleep environment makes a big difference.

Recommended Wake Time: Wake at the end of a full ~80-minute cycle, ideally during N2 (light sleep). This strategy is key to avoiding waking from deep sleep or active REM, which can lead to significant grogginess, disoriention, and prolonged crankiness in preschoolers.
Sleep Stage Functions (Research-Based):
N1 (Transition Sleep): A quick entry phase that gently prepares the brain and body for deeper rest. It's a very light stage from which a child can be easily awakened.
N2 (Light Sleep): This prominent stage is crucial for the development of motor skill memory, supports emotional regulation (helping them manage their increasingly complex feelings), and prepares the brain for new memory consolidation.
N3 (Deep Sleep): The primary driver of physical growth, immune system strength, and brain recovery from the day's energetic activities. This restorative stage is when the body undertakes significant repair and regeneration.
REM: Actively helps with emotional processing, fuels imagination and creative play, and hones early problem-solving abilities as the child processes and consolidates their learning.
👦 5–12 Years (School Age)
Sleep Onset Time: Typically begins in NREM stage N1, quickly followed by N2 (light sleep). This remains the standard and most efficient onset pattern for initiating sleep throughout most of childhood and adulthood.
Sleep Stage Composition: ~25% REM, ~75% NREM (Approx. 5% N1, 50% N2, 20% N3)
Important: Sleep at this stage becomes highly stable and very adult-like in its overall architecture. Slow-wave sleep (N3), the deepest stage of NREM, is particularly strong and concentrated during the early part of the night. This robust deep sleep is fundamentally important, supporting the intense physical growth, cellular repair, and significant mental development that characterizes the school-age years.
🧠 Research-Based Notes (Refined for 5–12 Years)
⏰ Sleep Cycles Have Matured
By this age, kids have 90-minute sleep cycles, just like adults. These stable rhythms help support their growing need for focused learning, physical energy, and emotional balance.
🛠️ Deep Sleep Happens Early
The first few cycles of the night are packed with deep sleep (N3) — this is when the body:
Heals and grows


Stores energy


Processes the day’s learning
 That’s why an early bedtime is so valuable!


🧠 Brain Power Builds in the Morning
As the night progresses, REM sleep becomes more active. This stage is essential for:
Emotional regulation


Problem-solving


Creativity and memory


The last few hours of sleep are when much of that "mental organizing" happens.
🧘‍♂️ Consistent Routines = Smarter Days
Kids need structure. A screen-free wind-down and set bedtime help:
Boost academic performance


Improve mood


Support overall health


Tip:
 Create a calm pre-bed routine that lasts 30–60 minutes. This could include a warm bath, reading together, or quiet time — just make sure screens are off at least an hour before bed.


Recommended Wake Time: Wake at the end of a full ~90-minute cycle, ideally during N2 (light sleep). This precise timing is optimized to help prevent sleep inertia—that lingering grogginess and morning fatigue—ensuring they wake feeling refreshed and ready for school and daily activities.
Sleep Stage Functions (Research-Based):
N1 (Transition Sleep): A brief, delicate bridge from wakefulness into deeper sleep stages. It represents minimal physiological changes but is a necessary entry point into the sleep cycle.
N2 (Light Sleep): This prominent and abundant stage is crucial for learning retention (solidifying new academic information), refining motor coordination, and integrating daily memories and skills.
N3 (Deep Sleep): The primary stage for promoting growth hormone release, bolstering immune function against illnesses, and facilitating long-term memory consolidation, especially for declarative memories (facts and events).
REM: Highly active for the brain, REM sleep enhances creativity, sharpens emotional regulation skills (critical for social interactions), and supports problem-solving skills as children process complex social and academic challenges.
🧑 13–17 Years (Adolescent)
Sleep Onset Time: Typically begins in NREM stage N1, quickly progressing to N2 (light sleep), similar to the established pattern observed in school-age children and adults.
Sleep Stage Composition: ~25% REM, ~75% NREM (Approx. 5% N1, 50% N2, 20% N3)
Important: Adolescents experience a unique and natural biological shift in their circadian rhythm, often referred to as a "sleep phase delay." This causes a tendency towards later sleep onset (feeling tired later) and later wake times. Compounding this, they have significantly increased sleep needs due to the profound and rapid brain development (brain 'rewiring') and intense physical changes occurring during puberty.

🧠 Research-Based Notes (Refined for 13–17 Years)
⏱️ Longer Sleep Cycles, Growing Brain
Teens now cycle through sleep in ~100-minute intervals, moving closer to full adult sleep architecture. This extended cycle supports brain development, memory, and hormonal balance during a time of major growth.
💤 Deep Sleep Starts to Dip
Deep sleep (N3) starts to decline in overall percentage compared to childhood — but it’s still essential. It helps with:
Physical recovery


Cell repair


Mental focus for the next day


Encouraging early, consistent bedtimes can help preserve more of it.
🧠 REM: The Emotional Equalizer
REM sleep takes center stage in adolescence. It plays a major role in:
Managing mood swings


Processing social and academic stress


Supporting emotional regulation in a time of intense self-discovery


📵 Modern Life Gets in the Way
Late-night screens, socializing, and heavy school loads can seriously mess with sleep quality and timing. Many teens don’t get the rest they need — and it shows in their mood, focus, and health.

Recommended Wake Time: Wake at the end of a full ~100-minute cycle, ideally during N2 (light sleep). This precise timing is crucial to minimize sleep inertia (that heavy, groggy feeling) and effectively support daytime alertness, concentration, and mood, which are essential for academic performance and social functioning.
Sleep Stage Functions (Research-Based):
N1 (Transition Sleep): The initial, light stage that prepares the brain for the deeper sleep stages. It's brief and signals the onset of the sleep cycle.
N2 (Light Sleep): Important for memory processing, particularly for procedural memories (skills and habits), and learning consolidation of the day's academic material and social interactions.
N3 (Deep Sleep): Supports profound physical restoration and recovery from sports and growth spurts, enhances immune function, and contributes to crucial brain plasticity—the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections.
REM: Absolutely critical for emotional regulation during a turbulent phase of development, sharpens social cognition (understanding social cues), and fuels creative problem-solving as adolescents navigate complex personal and academic challenges.
👨‍🎓 18–25 Years (Young Adult)
Sleep Onset Time: Typically begins in NREM stage N1, progressing to N2 within a few minutes. This is the well-established, efficient sleep onset pattern for healthy adults.
Sleep Stage Composition: ~25% REM, ~75% NREM (Approx. 5% N1, 45% N2, 25% N3)
Important: During this significant life stage, sleep architecture largely stabilizes, reaching its mature form. However, lifestyle choices wield immense influence over sleep quality and duration. Factors such as late nights (socializing, studying), high stress levels (academic, professional), and frequent use of stimulants like caffeine can heavily impact the ability to achieve restorative sleep and maintain optimal health.

🧠 Research-Based Notes (Refined for 18–25 Years)
⏳ Adult Sleep Cycles Are Fully In Place
Young adults now experience ~105-minute sleep cycles — a sign that their sleep architecture is fully matured. This rhythm helps support everything from focus to physical recovery.
🔧 Deep Sleep Slowly Starts to Fade
Deep sleep (N3) is still strong, but it’s beginning a slow, natural decline compared to teenage years. It remains crucial for:
Muscle repair


Energy restoration


Cognitive function and memory


Getting enough of it requires regular sleep hours and healthy routines.
🧠 REM Sleep: Your Brain’s MVP
REM demand is still high — and for good reason. This stage supports:
Creative thinking


Emotional resilience


Problem-solving
 It’s especially valuable during this phase of academic growth, work pressure, and complex relationships.


⚠️ Sleep vs. Lifestyle
Between late nights, busy schedules, and screen use, many young adults don’t get the rest they need. This leads to:
Brain fog


Low energy


Mood swings and decreased productivity


Recommended Wake Time: Best to wake at the end of a ~105-minute cycle, during N2 (light sleep). Waking during this lighter stage is proven to significantly reduce "sleep inertia" (that groggy, disoriented feeling upon waking) and improve clarity, alertness, and mood immediately upon rising.
Sleep Stage Functions (Research-Based):
N1 (Transition Sleep): A brief, initial stage that effectively initiates sleep. It's a very light phase, making it easy to wake from, but it's essential for entering the sleep cycle.
N2 (Light Sleep): This highly prevalent stage maintains daytime alertness, significantly aids in memory processing (especially for new facts and experiences), and supports motor learning (refining physical skills).
N3 (Deep Sleep): Crucial for profound physical recovery from daily activities, robust immune function (helping the body fight off illness), and essential cell repair and regeneration throughout the body.
REM: Actively enhances emotional intelligence, fuels creative thinking, and fosters mental flexibility needed to adapt to new situations and solve complex problems in academic and professional settings.
26–64 Years (Adult)
Sleep Onset Time: Typically begins in NREM stage N1, progressing quickly into N2. This remains the efficient and standard sleep onset pattern for healthy adults.
Sleep Stage Composition: ~25% REM, ~75% NREM (Approx. 5% N1, 45% N2, 25% N3 in early adulthood — N3 declines progressively with age)
Important: As adults progress through this broad age range, a key change in sleep architecture is the progressive decrease in deep sleep (N3), especially noticeable after age 40. This natural physiological shift can make sleep feel lighter and potentially more fragmented, with an increased likelihood of brief awakenings throughout the night. Understanding this decline helps manage expectations for sleep quality.
🧠 Research-Based Notes (Refined for 26–64 Years)
⏱️ Average Sleep Cycles = ~96 Minutes
Most adults experience sleep cycles that average around 96 minutes, though recent research shows they can range from 95 to 130 minutes depending on the person. This variation is completely normal and reflects individual sleep needs.
📉 Sleep Efficiency Slows Down
With age, many adults notice:
More time lying awake in bed


More frequent nighttime awakenings


Less time in deep, restorative sleep


These are common changes and not always signs of a sleep problem.
🧠 REM and N2 Stay Strong
Even as deep sleep (N3) declines, REM and light sleep (N2) remain stable. These stages support:
Mental clarity


Emotional regulation


Problem-solving and learning


They help you stay sharp and balanced in the face of daily demands.
⚠️ Life Gets in the Way of Sleep
Busy work lives, parenting, health concerns, and stress can seriously impact sleep quality in this stage of life.
Recommended Wake Time: Wake during light N2 at the end of a full ~96-minute cycle for optimal alertness and significantly reduced sleep inertia. This timing helps you feel most refreshed and ready to tackle the day's demands.
Sleep Stage Functions (Research-Based):
N1 (Transition Sleep): The lightest stage of sleep, serving as a rapid bridge into deeper sleep. It's the most fragile stage and from which individuals are most prone to disruption and awakening.
N2 (Light Sleep): This dominant stage supports procedural memory (how-to skills), consolidates motor skills, and processes sensory information from the day. It's crucial for maintaining general cognitive function and alertness.
N3 (Deep Sleep): Though it declines with age, N3 remains crucial for tissue growth and repair, robust immune support, and fundamental energy restoration at the cellular level.
REM: Promotes emotional stability and resilience, facilitates learning new complex information, and supports the creative integration of new ideas and experiences, which is vital for adaptability and innovation.
👴 65+ Years (Older Adult)
Sleep Onset Time: Still begins in NREM stage N1, but individuals in this age group may experience an increased sleep onset latency (taking longer to fall asleep).
Sleep Stage Composition: ~20% REM, ~80% NREM (Approx. 5% N1, 50% N2, 15–20% N3 — deep sleep further declines with age)
Important: Older adults commonly experience a natural shift towards lighter, more fragmented sleep. This often involves more frequent awakenings during the night and a tendency for earlier wake times. While total sleep time may decrease slightly, this varies widely based on individual health, lifestyle, and the presence of any underlying sleep disorders or medical conditions.

🧠 Research-Based Notes (Refined for 65+ Years)
🌙 Sleep Becomes More Fragmented
Older adults often experience lighter, more broken sleep. Deep sleep (N3) becomes less common, and sleep cycles may be shorter and less restorative than in earlier life stages.
🧠 REM Sleep Still Matters
REM sleep may decrease slightly and feel lighter, but it’s still vital for:
Emotional health


Memory consolidation


Brain maintenance
 Even in later life, this stage plays a key role in keeping the mind sharp.


😴 Daytime Naps Are Common — and Helpful
More frequent daytime napping is normal. It often helps compensate for fragmented nighttime sleep and can reduce fatigue, especially when naps are short and timed well.
🕰️ The Body Clock Shifts Earlier
Many older adults naturally start feeling sleepy earlier in the evening and wake up earlier in the morning — this is known as an advanced sleep phase.
 However, things like less sunlight exposure, social isolation, and medications can also affect this rhythm.
Recommended Wake Time: Aim to wake at the end of a full ~95-minute sleep cycle, ideally during light N2 sleep. This strategy provides the best chances of feeling refreshed and minimizes the impact of sleep inertia, supporting daily function and well-being.
Sleep Stage Functions (Research-Based):
N1 (Transition Sleep): This lightest stage is highly prone to disruption and frequent awakenings. It primarily serves as the entry point into the sleep architecture.
N2 (Light Sleep): Still the dominant sleep stage, N2 is crucial for maintaining cognitive function and alertness, supporting sensory memory, and facilitating basic day-to-day alertness.
N3 (Deep Sleep): Although less prevalent than in younger adults, N3 continues to aid in immune repair, regulate glucose metabolism, and contribute to overall physical restoration and vitality.
REM: Continues to be vital for emotional processing, particularly for navigating life changes and managing mood, for long-term memory consolidation, and for essential neural maintenance and brain plasticity, contributing to cognitive resilience.

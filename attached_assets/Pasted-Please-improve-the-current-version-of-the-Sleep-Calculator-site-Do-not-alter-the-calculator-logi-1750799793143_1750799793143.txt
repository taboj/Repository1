Please improve the current version of the Sleep Calculator site.
⚠️ Do not alter the calculator logic or main layout.
Apply the following UX/UI changes one at a time to avoid breaking any existing functionality.

✅ 1. Fix Scroll Behavior After “Calculate Sleep Time” Button Is Clicked
When the user clicks "Calculate Sleep Times", the page currently scrolls too far down and hides the “Recommended Bedtimes” title behind the sticky header.

Adjust scroll behavior to offset the scroll position by the sticky header height (~60–80px).

Ensure the scroll lands just before the section title, not on top of it.

✅ 2. Hide Previous Results When User Changes “Your Age” Dropdown
When the user selects a different age group from the "Your Age" dropdown:

Automatically hide the results section (Recommended Bedtimes and below).

Only show results again when “Calculate Sleep Times” is clicked.

This ensures results are always tied to an explicit calculation action.

✅ 3. Remove Final Section: “Sleep Science for X” (at Bottom of Page)
Remove the entire bottom section labeled:

“Sleep Science for Newborn” or “Sleep Science for Young Adult” (varies by age)

It is no longer needed and should not be rendered.

Make sure the removal doesn’t leave extra spacing or padding at the bottom.

✅ 4. Add Visual Toggle Indicators to Accordion Sections
For expandable sections like “Sleep Architecture”, “Sleep Stage Function”:

Add visual indicator (▼ for collapsed, ▲ for expanded).

Optionally add “Show more” / “Hide” labels.

Make toggle state clearly visible and animated if possible.

✅ 5. Improve Sleep Stage Pie Chart Readability
In the "Sleep Stage Composition" chart:

Bold and enlarge all label text.

Improve contrast between chart segments and labels.

Optional: add hover tooltips or display labels outside the pie for clarity.

✅ 6. Align and Standardize Icons Across All Cards and Boxes
In boxes like “How Sleep Works”, “Sleep Stage Function”, “Research Notes”:

Align icons to text baseline or center.

Use consistent icon size (preferably 16px–20px).

Add spacing between icon and text for clean alignment.

✅ 7. Improve Visual Variation in Sleep Cycle Analysis Section
Alternate the background color slightly between each result block (e.g., #F9FAFB, #FFFFFF).

Add a sleep cycle badge in each result:

e.g., 🌀 4 Cycles, 💤 5 Cycles

Make “EXCELLENT”, “FAIR”, etc. ratings stand out clearly.

✅ 8. Strengthen Section Header Styles
For sections like “Recommended Bedtimes”, “Sleep Cycle Analysis”:

Increase header font size and boldness.

Optionally add icons to headers for stronger scanning (e.g., 🧠, 📊, ⏰).

✅ After each update:

Ensure layout remains visually intact

Ensure no calculation or content logic is affected

Test scroll, dropdown, and click interactions

⚠️ Do not touch core functional logic, sleep cycle math, or backend API (if any).
